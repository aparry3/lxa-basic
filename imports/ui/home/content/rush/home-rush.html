          <p>Whether you are a transfer student, incoming freshman, or upperclassman, we encourage you to come

              by and check out Lambda Chi. We hold rush events year round, with the bulk of these events coming in

              the summer and early in the fall and spring semesters. Our rush chair, Aaron Stansell, is always available

              to answer any questions you have about our fraternity, our events, and how Lambda Chi pertains to life

              at Georgia Tech. We encourage you to reach out to Aaron via email at <a href="mailto:delta@gtlambdachi.org">delta@gtlambdachi.org</a> or by
              
              phone <a href="tel:2052457823">(205)-243-7823</a>. We look forward to hearing from you and hope to see you in the near future!</p>
